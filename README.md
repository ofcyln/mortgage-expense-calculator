## Motivation 

When you want to buy a property with a mortgage in the Netherlands, you need to have some amount of money to afford the expenses of a mortgage.

These expenses could be too difficult to calculate on the paper because of many considerations affecting each other items.

These difficulties consist:

* There are various cost items for getting a mortgage, and you need to organize them,

* These different expense items have special conditions and special cost ranges,

* There are also special conditions like compulsory expense or not which is affecting your total expense directly,

* Special conditions are also including upper limits depending on the mortgage amount,

* At the end of each calculation on the paper, you could be ending up with alternative scenarios of the expenses, and you could need to go over each item with optimistic and pessimistic scenarios.

So why not to automatically calculate it and help people to use it. ðŸ’¡

## Features

Mortgage Expense Calculator has been developed after a couple of one-on-one interview sessions with different financial advisors, and numerous research on the internet on related websites.

Calculation ranges in the application, are very accurate for those who want to use it.

All special conditions, like not compulsory expenses, maximum range condition depending on the mortgage amount, tax-return possible expenses, etc. were considered to calculate the best-estimated results. Also, all the expenses have special explanations.
